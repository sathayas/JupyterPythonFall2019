So I plan to cover very basic materials on simple programming, and possibly some topics pertinent to psychology studies (an emphasis on numerical data). Thus, if you have extensive prior programming experience or if you are looking for advanced materials on particular aspects of Python, this class may be too rudimentary for you. I have noticed that students with some prior programming experience tend to be bored and unhappy with this course because it is too easy and slow for them. I have also noticed that students familiar with another programming language can learn Python syntax on their own much quicker than attending a semester-long course. \n",

This is to avoid discrepancies between my master git repositories and your cloned repositories. Say, you edit or modify some documents (notes or codes) in your local git repository, and save under the same file name. Then Git will likely give you an error when you try to pull.
